Customer Segmentation is the practice of dividing a company's customers into groups that have similar characteristics between themselves. The goal of this segmentation is to get to know the different types of customers that the company has and how this customers behaves. Having that information, it becomes possible to create products and marketing specific to each group.

Companies that deploy customer segmentation are under the notion that every customer has different requirements and require a specific marketing effort to address them appropriately. Companies aim to gain a deeper approach of the customer they are targeting. Therefore, their aim has to be specific and should be tailored to address the requirements of each and every individual customer. Furthermore, through the data collected, companies can gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences as well as the requirements for discovering valuable segments that would reap them maximum profit. This way, they can strategize their marketing techniques more efficiently and minimize the possibility of risk to their investment.
